As expected of the Dane, we're two months behind. And of course, this project has long since ended. This is the final month of the grocery challenge. And the results are fairly pleasing.

| Total grocery bill       | $0.00     |
| Number of meals included | 67 (74%) |
| **Adjusted monthly cost**    | **$0.00**     |
| **Adjusted daily cost**      | **$0.00**      |

#The Finisher

So as you can see, I spent nothing on groceries this month. The groceries I bought at the end of March lasted me through most of this month. Additionally, I actually went out a bunch this month, so my groceries only supplied to 74% of the meals this month (I still had about a week's worth of groceries in the end, though).

So what value did I acquire at the end of March? Something I should have bought way earlier in the project: potatoes. I've always known they were insanely cheap, but I thought preparing potatoes would be a pain. Turns out they're really easy to make something mediocre. I would mostly just microwave them for "baked" potatoes (poke holes or something, throw in microwave for 3-5 mins, cut in half, and microwave for another couple minutes). Just melt some cheese on top of them and they're actually really delicious. Definitely at the top of the value chart.

Another good, new purchase was bagels. I was able to get a dozen of bagels for $2 (a pretty awesome deal). I bought some cream cheese to go with it for the delicious breakfasts. In terms of value, it's pretty okay. $2 + $1 (half a cream cheese) = 12 almost meals = $0.25 per almost meal < $0.50 per meal. Pretty okay indeed.

#Dane's Chart of Value


| Shnack          | Dane's Thoughts | Target Price |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Potatoes | Boil 'em, bake 'em, put 'em in a stew. Or just microwave them if you're lazy. | $2.00/10lb |
| Bagels | A pretty versatile bread, they're delicious with most things (I like cream cheese, normal cheese, peanut butter). | $2.00/dozen |
| Grapefruit | These guys are really inexpensive fruits for their weight. A solid choice for those short on fruit (like myself, at the time) | $0.50/large grapefruit |
