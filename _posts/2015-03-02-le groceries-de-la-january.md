A month late, but for everyone patiently waiting for the exciting results in January, here it is!

|                          |            |
|:-------------------------|-----------:|
| Total grocery bill       | $72.05     |
| Number of meals included | 88 (94.6%) |
| **Adjusted monthly cost**    | **$76.14**     |
| **Adjusted daily cost**      | **$2.46**      |


Here's what the numbers mean:

 - **Total grocery bill**: the amount of money I spent on groceries in January
 - **Number of meals included**: the number of meals that my grocery bill paid for (`total number of days*3 - meals at restaurants|fast food|free meals`). The number in parenthesis is the percentage of meals included.
 - **Adjusted monthly cost**: an extrapolation on the amount of money I would have spent on groceries (`total grocery bill / percentage of meals included`)
 - **Adjusted daily cost**: the most interesting number, it's the adjusted monthly cost per day (`adjusted monthly cost / days in the month`)

#Big Boys Only

Let me share with you the most important thing I learned: produce is too expensive. It's winter and pretty much every vegetable is a wallet destroyer (I paid $4 for a pound of lettuce; I'm never doing that again). Some vegetables are cheap almost all the time: potatoes, carrots, onions, almost anything that comes from the ground. Fruits are generally cheaper by weight, but the costs add up quickly. My rule of thumb for produce is less than $1/lb is a good price, $1-$1.50/lb is reserved for food I really want, and anything over $1.50 is not even an option.

The cheapest foods, as expected, are pasta, rice, and breads. Probably the best way to make the most out of the bland carbs is to put some sort of sauce on it. I found that pasta sauce and cheese go well with everything. Or you can be fancy and make some sort of potato, carrot, and onion curry. I ended up making pasta sauce with cheese, and just throwing it on bread, pasta, and rice for a week. Same thing with curry. Same thing with Dane's special fried, then baked, then reheated-in-a-microwave beans.

I think the real winner though, is the burrito. Take a pita, or real tortilla if they were on sale, throw all your leftovers on it, put it in the microwave or toaster oven (or both), and bam! You've just turned whatever scraps of food you had into a delicious burrito. My favourite things to throw in it were: rice, beans, pasta sauce, cheese.

#Dane's Chart of Value

| Monthly Ranking | Shnack          | Dane's Thoughts                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1               | Beans           | Insanely cheap, easy to make, and nutritious (providing the much needed fibre for the zero-vegetable diet). You don't even need to do anything  |
| 2               | Pitas/Tortillas | Chuck whatever leftovers you have onto this round piece of goodness, and you've got yourself a meal. See above for more details.                |
| 3               | Apples          | One of the only fruits that is consistently cheap, delicious, and fully edible (I've started eating everything except the stalk...).            |
