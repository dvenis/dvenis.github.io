I have always been an unfortunately cheap consumer, and it is something I've been trying to fix for a while now. Groceries are something we all have to buy, and yet if I don't pay attention I can end up paying exorbitant prices for even the simplest meals. That is why, in the next few months I will be conducting a research project: how little can I spend monthly on groceries, while also not forcing myself to eat garbage foods all the time (no instant noodles all day everyday).

Some details about myself to minimize subjectivity:
- I don't have taste buds. Not literally, but I can eat almost anything, especially if it has no taste.
- I don't normally prepare food that takes a long time
- I'm okay with eating the same food every meal for a week
- I don't have a car, so all groceries I buy will be brought home by bus, or by bike (when it gets warmer)

Another important thing to note that I will not be considering restaurant or fast food bills. This project isn't to see how little I can spend in a month, but to see how little I can spend on groceries per month. How much I spend eating out during this research will not be different from what I would spend eating out normally. For the sake of not being completely anti-social these costs will not be considered.

It's already been a month and a half since I started, so expect to see a month in review for January post coming out soon!
