#So What Happened?

Unfortunately, this month was a massive step back from the $2 a day I was able to get in February, and the worst month so far. There were a few factors that caused the massive increase in cost. Firstly, I bought a lot more food than I needed. I have a lot of rice, bread, and pasta (possibly enough to last me through April). This was partially because I overestimated how much I eat, and also that I ate out more in march than I expected. Secondly, I bought groceries near the end of the month. I was also hungry at the time, so I ended up buying a lot more than I normally would (especially too many apples at a mediocre price).

Past these issues, I did find something nice: dried soup mix. The type with several types of dried beans, lentils, peas, and whatnot. I was able to put together some sort of slop that lasted me for about five days of lunch and dinners. I used about $1.50 of soup mix (didn't finish the whole bag even) and some $2.00 of brown rice (definitely could get this nice and cheap if you're okay with buying the massive bags of non-brown rice). So that's about $0.35 a meal, which is pretty darn good. I already bought myself another bag for April.

#Dane's Chart of Value


| Shnack          | Dane's Thoughts | Target Price |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Dried Soup Mix | Boil these guys for an hour or so, add rice, pasta or whatever, and you have a delicious slop combination on your plate. Can easily be made in disgustingly large amounts. | $2.00/kg | 
| Carrots | Yes, a pretty obvious one. They're really healthy, delicious, and a staple for a lot of cooked foods. Literally just add it to any fried food, and it will probably taste good. | $0.33/lb | 
| (Cheap) Cheese | Not the first thing you'd expect as a value pick, and definitely not that great value. But they're amazing to put on anything to make it taste amazing. Throw it on some bread, put it in your pasta sauce (or slop) | $4/those big rectangle blocks |
