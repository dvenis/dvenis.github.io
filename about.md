I, whose name is actually Dan Venis, am a University of Waterloo student in the Mechatronics engineering program. I've lived in Toronto my whole life, and I'm hoping to experience wonderful things as I am exposed to the massive world outside.

Currently I am on a spiritual journey to find myself and all things that I can enjoy. Spiritual activities that I partake in include:

  - Programming (whatever project I'm in the mood for)
  - Video games (Leej of Lejends, osu!, Super Smash Brothers, Path of Exile, ...)
  - Playing piano
  - Being fairly frugal
  - Drinking tea
  
I am hoping to grow, and prune, this list as I journey from being Dane, to being the Great Dane.
