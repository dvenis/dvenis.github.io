My real name is Dan Venis and I am an enthusiast programmer, video game player, and musician. Currently I am a student at the University of Waterloo, in the Mechatronics Engineering program.

When I have free time I'll generally do one of the following:

  - Programming (whatever project I'm in the mood for)
  - Video games (Leej of Lejends, osu!, Super Smash Brothers, Path of Exile, ...)
  - Anime
  - Playing piano
  - Looking for sicknasty deals
  - Drinking tea
